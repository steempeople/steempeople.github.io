<p>오픽 시험 준비중입니다.</p>
<p>제 관심 주제에 대해 영어로 적어보고 있습니다.</p>
<hr />
<p>I wanna tell you the best movie I ve watched.</p>
<p>This movie name is “about time” which is british film.</p>
<p>Tim is main character and he can travel time.</p>
<p>Also, all man in his family can travel time.</p>
<p>Impressive scene I watched is</p>
<p>Father ask son like that</p>
<p>What do you want to do with this ability?</p>
<p>You should think about..</p>
<p>Son answer like that I just.. want</p>
<p>It would help me make girlfriend.</p>
<p>It is funny situation and make me think about what if I have this ability (travelling time).</p>
<p>Also, this move make me realize time is precious.</p>
<p>I want to live with all my heart so that I will not regret over time.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
<p>그리고 이 영화는 나에게 시간의 소중함을 다시한번 깨닫게 했다.</p>
<p>시간이 지나 후회하지 않도록 마음가는대로 전력을 다해 살아가고 싶다.</p>
<p>맞다. 여주인공은 너무 예뻣다. (맞다. 를 어떻게 영어로하지..)</p>
