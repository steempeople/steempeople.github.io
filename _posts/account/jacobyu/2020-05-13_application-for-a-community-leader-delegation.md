I wanna be a guide for helping new steemian be familiar with steem community.

#### Your experience on Steem

I am a developer and have played on STEEM community for about 2 years. Also, I am a member of steemcoinpan (one of popular nitrous community). I managed technical part of steemcoinpan. I have been making various tools for steem and steemcoinpan.

* free STEEM Signup tool with google auth en/ko,
https://join.steemcoinpan.com
* scot-manager (steem-engine coin listing, airdrop tool)
https://jacobyu.net/scot-manager
* curating voting system on steemcoinpan (https://steemcoinpan.com)
* token swap (https://steemcoinpan.com/market)

#### The Community you run, including what it covers, its history, and how it operates

I am running Steem book club.  This community started in February 2020. Anybody can be a member on this club.

In bookclub, people read the book and share our feelings. Also, we discuss  and recommend the book that people enjoied.

If you write more than one book review, you are a member. Members do not need to write directly to the community. Cross posting is ok. 


#### Ways you are promoting your Community and recruiting new members

* I am trying to get members on offline book club members.
* I made a video for signing in STEEM easily and how to join community.

#### Any special activities in your Community

I am developing and running goodhabit beta service. goodhabit gives people mission (such as reading book, going to fitness). Once users pay the entry fee and do the mission, users can get the entry fee and prize. (@goodhabit, https://goodhabit.me)

For promoting reading book, I made a reading-book mission at the goodhabit. My club members joined the mission. They paid entry fee and read book. and then they wrote book-review.

#### Your future plans for the Community

There are many people who love books. There are many book clubs in the world. However, there is no active STEEM community that share thought about book. I want to build a book club community that connects offline and online.

I want to collect book reviews in the world. As time goes by, book reviews will accumulate in our community. Once the review is written in STEEM, it does not disappear. These book reviews can be good content. Also anyone can get the book review with steem api. It can be a database. Then people who like books will naturally come to STEEM and come to our community.

My dream is making people enter the community and write posting easily without knowing steem posting key and blockchain.  Goodhabit page (https://goodhabit.me) is one of step for this. I want to make app and webpage for our community for getting enter easily.

#### The name and hive-123456 type address of the Community.

Our community name is Book club Community.

Tag is hive-197929, https://steempeak.com/c/hive-197929/created

Thank you.
