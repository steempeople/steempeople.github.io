Hi, I want to apply community curators. 


Thank you!!




## The Community or subject areas you would like to curate


There are many people who love books. There are many book clubs in the world. However, there is no active STEEM community that share thought about book. I want to build a book club community that connects offline and online.






Book club with STEEM has three advantages.


##### 1. Motivation


The reason you would like to curate is I want to give book-lovers **reward and motivation.** STEEM voting is good motivation for writing book review. 


##### 2. Together


Reading book together is better than reading book alone. It is difficult for people to meet due to the COVID-19 these days. This community will help people who like books communicate with each other. The comments of people are also really good motivation for keeping reading book.


##### 3. No disappear


As time goes by, book reviews will accumulate in our community. Once the review is  written in STEEM, **it does not disappear**. These book reviews can be good content. Also anyone can get the book review with steem api. It can be a database. Then people who like books will naturally come to Steam and come to our community.

## Any languages you are fluent in




I am Korean. I am fluent in Korean. 


The main target of this community is Korean. However, the community is open. I welcome anyone who wants to be an English or Chinese curator. Once I get power, I try to find curators.

## Why you think you would make a good curator


I can be a good curator.


##### 1. I have experence of running book club


I can bring people who like books outside of Steam. I have been running an offline book club for a year and a half. the number of offline book club is 60. We have a regular meeting once a week or once 2 weeks. The experience of running book club helps me run and curate book club in steem community.

##### 2. I am a developer


I am good developer that can use STEEM library. I made some tools/service on STEEM. I can use the existing service I made. 


* easy signup tool
* voting-bot for giving members motivation
* @goodhabit for giving members motivation

##### 3. I can give members motivation 


I think motivation is important on running community. I am trying to give members reward/motivation. When I get a account that has high steem power, I will utilize steem power like below way.


When members write a post or they comment other members` the post, I will vote. I can voting with both voting-bot I made and manual voting. It can be motivation for letting people active in the community.




I am developing and running goodhabit beta service. [goodhabit](http://goodhabit.me/) gives people mission (such as reading book, going to fitness). Once users pay the entry fee and do the mission, users can get the entry fee and prize.


With steem power, I will support the prize for writing a book review mission. It makes members keep writing book reviews. 


The way support the prize is below.


1. @goodhabit write `a introduction of mission` posting
2. the account with steem power votes the posting
3. the payout of author reward (steem/sbd) supports the prize of the mission (write a book review)

I think Book club with STEEM can be unique book club in the world. I hope this suggestion is accepted so that many people come and talk about books.
