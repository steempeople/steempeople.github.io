Hi,

Frankly.. I change my story about my love to wordpress story.

Because I thought that many people can watch this post.

Anyway...

Now I applied wordpress-steem plugin and wrote this.

I found this plugin while reading steemdev.

I think that if I write wordpress and paste to steemit, this is very good.

Because wordpress form is familiar with me.

Also, I can write my hompage and earn steem. 

Very good Idea.

you can search "wordpress steem"at plugin list and install.

this post is last post that the developer wrote.

<a href="https://steemit.com/steemdev/@recrypto/wordpress-steem-update-and-statistics-as-of-october-2017">wordpress-steem post</a>

But, I meet error..

"Please wait for 300 seconds to be able to publish this post to the Steem blockchain as there is a 5 minute cooldown."

So I searched.. how to solve this problem.

I am developer, so I believe that I can solve this problem.

If I solve this problem, I will share..

Thank you for reading this.
