Hi all,

I want to share my favorite game.

<strong>Little figther 2</strong>

you can download this game below link.

Or, you can play on web.
<a href="http://www.projectf.hk/F.LF/game/game.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.projectf.hk/F.LF/game/game.html</a>

Little fighter is Hong Kong freeware PC fighting game for Windows.
When I was young, I played this game with my friends.
